# theUltimatePenguinRace
Inspired by "Penguin Champion Race" in Nintendo's "Super Mario 64", the aim of this project is to implement the move of the penguin intelligently, based on algorithms of shortest path detection. (incomplete, functions not yet implemented) 
To run, simply type "./run" if you are using macOS X. Installation of OpenGL is also required
